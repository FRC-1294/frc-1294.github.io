The (in development) website for FRC 1294: Top Gun.

## Why a new website?
The current website, [team1294.org](http://www.team1294.org/) is a pretty good website. It was created in 2014, and has served us well. However, it has become a bit difficult to maintain. It was written in PHP, and requires knowledge of the complex systems of `include`s and `less` files that we use. Certain pages have fallen into disrepair, like the forms, about, and contact pages. In addition, those with PHP (or any web knowledge) inevitably graduate out of the team, leaving behind webmasters that don't know how to update the website.
