    <h3>How to Use <code>img-with-caption</code></h3>
</div>

<div class="content-block extend">
    <code>img-with-caption</code> is a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">Jekyll include</a>.
    It is a file in the project, located at <code>_includes/img-with-caption.html</code>.<br>
    <br>
    This include is for creating a figure, an image with a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for a caption, and links
    the image to it's src url for viewing the full image. All of this structure is done in one <code>{% raw %}{% include %}{% endraw %}</code>.<br>
    <br>
    This code when placed into a page will create the below image and caption, as seen on the <a href="/subteams/electrical/">electrical page.</a><br>

    {% highlight liquid %}
        {% raw %}
{% include img-with-caption.html
    file="/assets/img/subteams/electrical/frc_3128_wiringdiagram.png"
    alt="FRC Control System Wiring Diagram"
    caption='A new, up to date wiring diagram for the FRC control system by team 3128 -- Found on
    <a href="https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1778684#post1778684">Chief Delphi</a>'
%}
        {% endraw %}
    {% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="content-block">
    {% include img-with-caption.html
        file="/assets/img/subteams/electrical/frc_3128_wiringdiagram.png"
        alt="FRC Control System Wiring Diagram"
        caption='A new, up to date wiring diagram for the FRC control system by team 3128 -- Found on

<div class="content-block extend">
    <code>img-with-caption</code> takes three parameters: <code>file</code>, <code>alt</code>,
    and <code>caption</code>. <code>file</code> and <code>caption</code> are pretty self
    explanitory: the path to the image and the caption for the image respectively. <code>alt</code>
    is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Attributes">
    "an alternative text description of the image"</a>, typically for use in the event the image
    can't be loaded, accessiblity, or some other reason a text representation of an image is needed.<br>
    <br>
    In the event one of these parameters is ommited, defaults are used, but they generally aren't wanted,
    as for most pages they look pretty silly.
