# Interested in supporting our team?

We appreciate all contributions and donations to our team. Every year it takes a lot of money to sustain our team, from registration fees
to travel, lodging, and transportation costs, to parts, to food to feed the team during long work days.

Contributions are tax deductible through the Eastlake Wolfpack Association, a 501(c)(3) organization. Their tax ID is **77-0616862**.

Feel free to contact us with any questions or comments: <contactus@team1294.org>

## Via Check

The easiest way to donate to our team is via check -- without processing fees, we can utilize your entire contribution, and it's a simple as sending a piece of mail.
