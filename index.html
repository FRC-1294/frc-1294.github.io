  <p style="width: 85%;">
    We are a <a href="https://firstinspires.org/frc"><em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competiton</a>
    team based at <a href="https://ehs.lwsd.org">Eastlake High School</a> in Sammamish, WA.
    We teach high school students STEM skills by building an up to 6 foot, 120 pound robot for
    participating in robotics competitions every year. From building to programming to fundraising
    to leadership, everything is student designed, student built, and student run.
